### Horn Flies

-   Identification:

    -   Congregate along the back and sides of cattle
    -   Small (3-5mm)
    -   Bloodfeeders

-   Prevention and Control:

    -   Ear-tags should be used once 100-200 flies per cow are present to help avoid resistance and should be removed in the fall
    -   Pour-ons such as ivermectin can be used but are only effective about 28 days so reapplication is necessary
    -   Back rubbers and dust bags can be effective when hung in locations cattle can self treat and don’t require handling of cattle
    -   Oral larvicides can be beneficial mixed in feed or mineral but only protect against more larvae, not from adult flies

### Face Flies

-   Identification:

    -   Dark gray in color
    -   6-8 mm in size
    -   Non-biting, but contribute to pink eye
    -   Congregate around wounds as well as ocular and nasal discharge

-   Prevention and Control:

    -   Pyrethroid ear tags
    -   Pour-ons
    -   Back rubbers and dust bags can be effective when hung in locations cattle can self treat and don’t require handling of cattle
    -   Control can be more difficult as these flies spend fewer moments on the cattle

### Stable Flies

-   Identification:

    -   Gray with checkerboard pattern
    -   7-8 mm in size
    -   Bloodfeeders
    -   Congregate on legs
    -   Present mid-May through September

-   Prevention and Control:

    -   Sanitation is most effective, removing locations for larvae to develop such as manure piles
    -   Measures should be taken when even 5 flies per head are present
    -   Tend to rest in shaded areas and premise spraying can create some relief
