Nora Schrag received her DVM from Kansas State University in 2006, and then spent her first year of practice in the Chaco region of Paraguay.  For the next 6 years she enjoyed rural mixed animal practice in southeast Nebraska.  She then returned to Kansas State College of Veterinary Medicine to teach livestock field services.  This position eventually transitioned into doing research, a PhD, and board certification in clinical pharmacology (Dip. ACVCP).  Nora enjoys the challenge of applying research within the real world of clinical practice.  Her time is split between practice in the flint hills of Kansas and doing data analytics for a variety of veterinary related projects.
